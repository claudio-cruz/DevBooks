              <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-0 small">Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert T.
                Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It advocates the importance
                of financial literacy (financial education), financial independence and building wealth through
                investing in
                assets, real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one's financial
                intelligence (financial IQ).

                Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, ostensibly based on Kiyosaki's life.[1]
                The
                titular "rich dad" is his friend's father who accumulated wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy
                investing,
                while the "poor dad" is claimed to be Kiyosaki's own father who he says worked hard all his life but
                never
                obtained financial security.</p>

              <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-0 small">Think and Grow Rich is a book written by Napoleon Hill in
                1937 and promoted as a personal development and self-improvement book. He claimed to be inspired by a
                suggestion from business magnate and later-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.[1]

                First published during the Great Depression,[2] the book has sold more than 15 million copies[3]

                It remains the biggest seller of Napoleon Hill's books. BusinessWeek magazine's Best-Seller List ranked
                it the sixth best-selling paperback business book 70 years after it was published.[4] Think and Grow
                Rich is listed in John C. Maxwell's A Lifetime "Must Read" Books List.[5]

                While the book's title and much of the writing concerns increasing income, the author proclaims that his
                philosophy can help people succeed in any line of work, to do and be anything they can imagine.[6]

                Think and Grow Rich is based on Hill's earlier work The Law of Success, and is the result of more than
                twenty years of study of many individuals who had amassed personal fortunes.[2]

                Hill studied their habits and drew some 16 "laws" to be applied to achieve success. Think and Grow Rich
                condenses them, providing the reader with 14 principles in the form of a "Philosophy of Achievement".[2]
