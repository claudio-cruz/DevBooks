DevBooks is a platform where readers can find the best self-development books on the market, ranked and evaluated by readers and not us.

Readers can express their thoughts on the books they have read, read other readers' thoughts about particular books in which they are interested or not, and make a decision whether to read that book or not.

The books are ranked from the most liked (at the top of the page) to the least liked (at the bottom of the page). We also provide book categories so that users who are more interested in specific genres can filter books by the category they are looking for.

Our goal is for self-development book readers to easily find books that interest them to read next, using an easy and intuitive platform with short but concise book descriptions, feed back from other readers, and a list of filtered books by category that are ranked by reader likes from the top of the page to the bottom of the page. We also provide a "Buy Book" link that redirects users to the book seller page so that they can buy the books they like.

This website is made up of the following sections:

1. Home Page / contains a list of all books
2. Finace Category / contains the finance book list
3. Spiritual Category / contains the spiritual book list
4. Health Category / contains the health book list
5. Leadership Category / contains the leadership book list

## UX
---
### **Strategy**

With the UX in mind, I started to think about who the target users would be and how this website would help them reach their goals.

DevBooks target users are:
* Aged 12-60
* Readers who like self-development books
* People who are interested in self-growth and self-development

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear and concise information about self-development books
* List of the best self-developmemt books
* Readers feed back on each book
* A "Buy Book" link on every single book

This website reaches all those points, and more will be added in the future, like a "My Page" area where users can go and have access to their own information and be able to edit it, access to a favorite book list where users can add their favorite books to their own list, add new books to the main list (upon admin approval), and new categories will be added.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user and business goals, the following features will be included in this release:
* Navigation bar fixed on the top of each page to make navegation easy and intuitive
* Category Search dropdown list to filter the books by category
* Book Search dropdown list to isely find the book users are looking for
* Five diferent book categories(finance, spiritual, health, leadership, biographies)
* Register, login and logout futures
* Add a comment, edit a comment, or delete a comment.
* Like or dislike a book

### **Structure** 

Webpage scheme

Database scheme
![](/static/images/database_scheme.png)

This website is structured as follows:
* Home page with a fixed navigation bar at the top, a search dropdown list, a list of all the books, and a footer
* Five category pages (finance, spiritual, health, leadership, and biographies) filtering the book list by categories
* About us page, with information about the website's goals and purpose
* Login and Logout pages for logging in and out
* Register page to create an account

### **Skeleton**

The skeleton of the website has changed since the initial draws. Originally, it was intended to be a simple home page with a tipping search bar where users could write and navigate to specific categories and books. During the website's development, I changed that to a list display of all the books ordered by the number of user likes. with two dropdown lists on the top of the book lists, one with the categories and the other with the books, making a better user experience.

The category pages were originally planned to have a top book list ranked by the admin, but with the development of the website, I decided to rank the books by the number of user likes so that users make the ranks and not the admin.

Both the login, logout, and registration pages are very similar, with a container in the middle of the page with the same sign just changing the content inside that container to create a better user experience.

### **Surface**

To avoid confusing users, I try to keep the website as simple as possible, with as few sections, buttons, and texts. Because users require high contrast and light colors for a better user experience, I used high color contrast and light colors.

For easy navigation, all the pages have a "go to top" button, reducing the scroling up and down. Also,Â  the book comment section has a dropdown button with all the user approved comments for a particular book and a go to the top of the comments button at the bottom of the comments.

I will go more in depth about this in the features section.

This website has a fixed navigation bar at the top containing the DevBooks logo, and the home button, both of which redirect users to the home page when clicked. It also has a categories dropdown button with the five categories available (finance, spiritual, health, leadership, and biographies), each of those category buttons redirects users to the respective category pages. After the categories button is the "About Us" button that redirects users to the About Us page, where users can find information about the webpage.

The navigation bar changes depending on whether the user is logged in or out.If users are logged in, a logout button appears in the navigation bar; if users are logged out, a login and register button appears in the navigation bar.

The navbar is responsive; it works with small screens, as shown in the wireframe above.

The book lists on the home page and the category pages are ordered by the number of users who have liked them. Each book has a specific book title, book image, book description, and on the bottom of the book description, users can see the number of likes and comments that that specific book has. Users can also like or dislike the book by clicking on the heart logo, buy the book by clicking on the "Buy Book" button, and see the book comments in the dropdown button. If users are logged in, they can also add comments (upon admin approval of each comment) and edit or delete their own comments.
