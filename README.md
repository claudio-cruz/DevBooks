DevBooks is a platform where readers can find the best self-development books on the market, ranked and evaluated by readers and not us.

Readers can express their thoughts on the books they have read, read other readers' thoughts about particular books in which they are interested or not, and make a decision whether to read that book or not.

The books are ranked from the most liked (at the top of the page) to the least liked (at the bottom of the page). We also provide book categories so that users who are more interested in specific genres can filter books by the category they are looking for.

Our goal is for self-development book readers to easily find books that interest them to read next, using an easy and intuitive platform with short but concise book descriptions, feed back from other readers, and a list of filtered books by category that are ranked by reader likes from the top of the page to the bottom of the page. We also provide a "Buy Book" link that redirects users to the book seller page so that they can buy the books they like.

This website is made up of the following sections:

1. Home Page / contains a list of all books
2. Finace Category / contains the finance book list
3. Spiritual Category / contains the spiritual book list
4. Health Category / contains the health book list

## UX
---
### **Strategy**

With the UX in mind, I started to think about who the target users would be and how this website would help them reach their goals.

DevBooks target users are:
* Aged 12-60
* Readers who like self-development books
* People who are interested in self-growth and self-development

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear and concise information about self-development books
* List of the best self-developmemt books
* Readers feed back on each book
* A "Buy Book" link on every single book

This website reaches all those points, and more will be added in the future, like a "My Page" area where users can go and have access to their own information and be able to edit it, access to a favorite book list where users can add their favorite books to their own list, add new books to the main list (upon admin approval), and new categories will be added.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user and business goals, the following features will be included in this release:
* Navigation bar fixed on the top of each page to make navegation easy and intuitive
* Category Search dropdown list to filter the books by category
* Book Search dropdown list to isely find the book users are looking for
* Five diferent book categories(finance, spiritual, health, leadership, biographies)
* Register, login and logout futures
* Add a comment, edit a comment, or delete a comment.
* Like or dislike a book
